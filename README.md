# Spark-Kafka-Scala

## Overview

This repository contains Scala scripts and configuration files for integrating Apache Spark with Apache Kafka. The project demonstrates how to handle real-time data streams from Kafka using Spark, including setup, processing, and logging configurations.

### Repository Structure

- **`src/main/scala`**:
  - Contains Scala source files with the main code for integrating Spark with Kafka.
  - Includes examples and implementations of data stream processing from Kafka topics.

- **`target`**:
  - Contains the compiled output of the Scala project. It is automatically generated when the project is built.

- **`LICENSE`**:
  - The MIT license file for the project. The MIT License allows for free use, modification, and distribution of the code with proper attribution.

- **`README.md`**:
  - The README file providing an overview of the project, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.

- **`build.sbt`**:
  - The build configuration file for the Scala project, specifying dependencies and build settings for the project.

- **`log4j.properties`**:
  - Configuration file for Log4j, a logging utility used for managing application logs.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

### 1. **Set Up the Environment**

- **Apache Kafka**: Ensure Apache Kafka is installed and running.
- **Apache Spark**: Ensure Apache Spark is installed and properly configured to work with Kafka.

### 2. **Build the Project**

- Navigate to the project directory.
- Use `sbt` to compile and build the project:
  ```sh
  sbt clean compile package
  ```

### 3. **Run the Spark Application**

- Execute the Spark application to process data from Kafka:
  ```sh
  spark-submit --class <MainClass> --master <SparkMasterURL> target/scala-<version>/spark_kafka_scala_*.jar
  ```
  Replace `<MainClass>` with the main class of your Spark application, `<SparkMasterURL>` with your Spark master URL, and adjust the jar file path as needed.

### 4. **Logging Configuration**

- Configure logging by modifying the `log4j.properties` file if needed. This file controls how log messages are recorded and displayed.

## Usage

- **Kafka Integration**: The project demonstrates how to connect Spark with Kafka, consume data from Kafka topics, and process it using Spark.
- **Data Processing**: Scripts are provided for various data processing tasks, including filtering, aggregating, and writing results.
